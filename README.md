The analysis of large volumes of information can help determine where the most errors are found for a given project or thousands of projects. This information can be used to generate adequate tests and to mitigate the errors produced in the Pipelines.

The Gitlab-CI tool is being widely used for the ease they offer in the integration of automated deployment of projects. It offers the possibility to automate every step from the push of a new commit to the secure deployment on servers.

In this post I show how to perform a data collection using the gitlab and nodejs apis. This data can be used to create different types of big data analysis
